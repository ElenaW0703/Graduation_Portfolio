# Graduation Portfolio - Sepsis Detection by Machine Learning Techniques \
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue
damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). According to WHO and CDC's data, nearly 270k+
people die from Sepsis, and 24 billion would be spent on the treatment of Sepsis in U.S hospitals each
year. It could be life-saving and cost-saving if the Sepsis condition of a patient could be diagnosed in
advance by using several vital signs. Our goal is to use Electronic Medical Record(EMR) data which is
sourced from ICU patients from 3 separate hospitals, to develop the best machine-learning algorithm in
order to predict each patient’s sepsis status by using selected vital signs. Our data is provided by the
Physionet database, which is a repository of freely-available medical research data. Since this widely-used
database is managed by MIT lab and sponsored by NIH, we could consider that it is an authentic and
practical real-world medical record and could be used to represent the information of potential Sepsis
patients. It is reported that K-nearest-Neighbour (KNN) has satisfied Sepsis predictions(Perng et al.,
2019) while GB-boost and Random Forest may have better performance(Ke li et al.). Therefore, there are
many mature machine learning algorithms and a range of programming software in use for machine
learning algorithms in the diagnosis of Sepsis status. After conducting each algorithm, we will compare
the test error rate and train error rate as well as compare the accuracy and efficiency for different models.
Therefore, We believe our actionable proposed model could be used in the future and real world to help
reduce the odds of having Sepsis and save costs.
